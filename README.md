##### Text/sentence conversion into random, sentence, capital, upper, lower, slug case including illegal case removal! Privacy friendly, quick, free and open source!

### Why:
While checking out various tools online for my own sentence case switching needs, I found out that some tools relied on server side script to do this (Why? Your guess is as good as mine). The other tools obfuscated their javascript code, making it impossible to understand if there's any monkey business happening with your text inputs. 

Additionally, as developers there are a few additional features we need that just don't come with the standard tools out there. Slugifying text, escaping text, etc. 

### Features: 

- Easy Text/sentence conversion into random, sentence, capital, upper, lower, slug-case including illegal case removal.  
- Built using simple vanilla javascript. 
- Free. Lightweight. Quick. Works directly within the browser.  
- Helpful for copywriters, designers, website developers and digital marketers.  
- Removes any existing styling from your current text. Comes in handy when you're copy pasting things into your design tools and need to remove formatting. 
- Switch up the sentence casing without worrying about privacy.  
- Revision history created for each time you refresh this window.  
- SW Ready: If you install this site on your homescreen, it'll even work offline!
